# QR_code_creation

QR codes, short for Quick Response codes, are two-dimensional barcodes that can store various types of information, such as text, URLs, contact information, and more. Generating QR codes in Python is relatively straightforward, thanks to libraries like 'qrcode'. 

Steps:
1. Installation: First, you'll need to install the 'qrcode' library if you haven't already. You can use 'pip' to install it:
   pip install qrcode[pil]

2. Import the Library: Next, import the necessary libraries in your Python script.

3. Display or Save the QR Code: You can display the QR code using an image viewer or save it to a file, as shown in the code above. Replace "qr_code.png" with your preferred file name and format (e.g., "my_qr_code.png").

4. Customize QR Codes: You can customize the appearance of the QR code by adjusting parameters like box_size, border, fill_color, and back_color to fit your design requirements.

5. Additional Options: Depending on your use case, you may want to explore more advanced features of the qrcode library, such as adding a logo to the QR code or creating QR codes for different data types.
